 <h2>IS295: Project Overview</h2>

 <div class="readyset">


 <h3>Mission</h3>

 <dl>
  <dt>What problem does this project address?</dt>

  <dd>
    Based on a study conducted by Crisanto (2022), the current task-managing
    or productivity-tracking applications available in the market fail to
    meet the feature requirements prioritized by the faculty and staff of
    the University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU) for effective
    planning and productivity tracking. Therefore, the project aims to
    propose a potential solution to address the feature requirements that
    the majority of the intended users need, in order to fill the gap and
    provide a system that can meet their requirements.
  </dd>

  <dt>What is the objective of this project?</dt>

  <dd>The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate the usefulness
    of a web-based application provistionally called &ldquo;Sipag&rdquo;.
    Sipag serves as an efficient and beneficial task-management and
    productivity-tracking tool for the UPOU community.</dd>
 <dt>What are some key features that define the product?</dt>

 <dd>
  <ul>
   <li>Includes features that the UPOU community deems essential.</li>

   <li>Familiar and effective user interface.</li>

   <li>AI enabled features.</li>

   <li>Cross-platform and synchornized across devices.</li>
  </ul>
 </dd>

 <dt>What makes this product different from others?</dt>

<dd>Sipag is a web-based planner and productivity tracker that aligns with the
  practices of faculty and staff of the University of the Philippines Open
  University (UPOU) for planning and productivity tracking. The proposed system
  has a unique selling point as it is based on a research-based approach that
  akes it more effective in planning and productivity tracking for the UPOU
  community. While other applications may have well-designed feature sets for
  their target user bases, the proposed applicationâ€™s feature sets cater to the
  specific needs of the UPOU community. Future studies could expand on this
  research-based approach to designing information systems for other communities,
  making them more effective tools for planning and productivity tracking.</dd>
</dl>

 <h3>Scope</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>What is the scope of this project?</dt>

 <dd>The scope of this project is to build a web application called Sipag
 (provisionally) that is based on industry best practices and standards.
 The goal is to strategically plan and execute the development of a
 production-grade application that will be beneficial to the UPOU community.
 </dd>

 <dt>What are the high-level assumptions or ground rules for the project?</dt>

 <dd>
<ul>
  <li>It is a assumed that the target release date cannot be moved.</li>
  <li>It is assumed that the project will comply users' data privacy rights.</li>
  <li>It is assumed that the application users will do their best of protect their data privacy.</li>

  <li>
    <strong>Ground Rules:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Be AGILE</li>
      <li>Test driven development. Test early and often</li>
      <li>Always apply SOLID principles</li>
      <li>Keep it DRY</li>
      <li>YAGNI</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
 </dd>

 <dt>What are we not going to do?</dt>

 <dd>
    This project will not attempt to compete in the software market. It will be
    developed in the hope that it will be a useful tool for the UPOU community.
 </dd>

 <dt>Is this project part of a larger effort?</dt>

 <dd>
    No, this project is not part of a larger effort.
